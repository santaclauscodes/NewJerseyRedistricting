Code repository for New Jersey redstricting homework assignment

We need to write a linear programming function that redistricts New Jersey into
new congressional districts based on 2020 census data. One of the constraints of this
assignment was that counties could not be split. Since New Jersey has a relatively small
number of counties and is densely populated, this limits options for created congressional
districts of equal size.
